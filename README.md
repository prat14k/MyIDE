# MyIDE

MyIDE is a project intended to make an integrated development environment,kind of similar to notepad++,where you can code or simply create files.

You can create new file, or open an existing file.
You can save it or you can also perform a saveAs option in order to save it as a different file or name.
MyIDE offers features like cut,copy and paste of any normal text in the files opened.
You may perform a search on the file to in order to search something as well as replace it with sommething else.

The extra feature MyIDE offers is that you can compile your source code as well as execute it if your file is one of these extension:-
  -> .c (C file)
  -> .cpp (C++ file)
  -> .rb (Ruby file)
  -> .py (Python file)
  -> .java (Java File)

If your file is one of these , you can simply compile or execute your source code files.
Right now, MyIDE is not made for compiling or executing source code files having package declarations in it.So, it will only be able to work fine for files with default package.  

Also, if your code requires input, then put your input in a file,and then you can select your input file by clicking on the "Input File Choosing" Button so that we can fetch the input for the source code.

This project was made in Eclipse IDE.

As it is an executable jar, to run the jar, you can do either of these two things:- 
  ->double click on it
  ->or run it via command promt using this :  
                                java -jar myJar.jar
                                
Hope you like it. 
Happy coding ;) :P
